On **Windows**, SwiftPM is failing to resolve **any Tokamak versions â‰¥0.12.x**, because Tokamakâ€™s GitHub releases are **mostly tagged for macOS targets**, and SwiftPM on Windows cannot satisfy the platform requirements.

So unfortunately:

* **Tokamak cannot currently be resolved on Windows with SwiftPM**.
* Thatâ€™s why all attempts (`0.13.0`, `0.12.1`) fail.
* Even though Tokamak is cross-platform in theory, in practice **Windows Swift support is very limited**.

## ðŸ’¡ Implications for your project

1. **Native Swift web app via Tokamak is effectively blocked on Windows**.
2. **You cannot build or resolve TokamakShim on your current Windows + Swift setup**.

## âœ… Alternative approaches

Since your instructor allows **cross-platform apps**, you can still:

### 1. **Flutter**

* Full cross-platform UI (Android/iOS/Web).
* Easy to implement VIPER-like separation.
* Runs on Windows, no Mac needed.
* Web version can satisfy the 3-page requirement.

### 2. **React / React Native**

* React web + mobile app with VIPER-style architecture.
* Also fully cross-platform.
* Web version accessible on iOS browser.

### 3. **Console app (Swift)**

* Still possible on Windows.
* Limited UI, but VIPER architecture can be practiced.

âš  Recommendation: **Switch to Flutter** for your Movie Tracker app.

* You can implement **Home, Detail, Favorites, Profile** screens.
* Maintain VIPER layers: Entities, Interactors, Presenters, Router, View.
* Works on Windows and produces a web version for mobile testing.

If you want, I can **rewrite your Movie Tracker project in Flutter using VIPER architecture**, ready for **Windows development**, so you can build and submit it.
